# Introduction

In this part, you will learn about the main capabilities in SAP Data Intelligence Metadata Explorer, then you will get a preview about the dataset used in the hands-on.

## SAP Data Intelligence - Overview

SAP Data Intelligence allows to connect, discover, enrich, and orchestrate disjointed data assets into actionable business insights at enterprise scale.

It's core capabilities are:
* Data Integration
* Data Processing
* Data Cataloging

### Data Integration

With SAP Data Intelligence, you can integrate any kind of data (structured, unstructured or streaming), with any pattern (real-time, near-real-time, batch), enrich it, refine it and feed process it.

SAP Data Intelligence Modeler is a flow-based application that allows to build powerful pipelines using drag-and-drop operators.
There are over 250 operators (data integration, connectivity, processing, data quality, ML ...) that allows to combine and switch between integration styles (streaming, batch, replication, virtualization, migration, ...).

The operators are extensible and the application supports custom and partner operators.

The data pipelines also support data workflows for cross-system orchestration (trigger execution of SAP BW Process chains, execute remote SAP Data Services jobs, submit Spark jobs to Hadoop clusters, ...).

SAP Data Intelligence modeler enables to create complex, multistep, reusable data pipelines and operators.

### Data Processing

With SAP Data Intelligence, you can explore your data assets, create and validate your models, and orchestrate any mix of data processing engines, seamlessly within the data pipelines that feed them.

SAP Data Intelligence Machine Learning Manager seamlessly accelerate machine learning models deployment and operation. This is a one single interface that allows you to see and orchestrate all data-driven applications and data flows across the organization with tools to help manage governance, auditability, and transparency.

It comes with an interactive development environment to work with notebooks, code, and data including text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other custom components side by side with notebooks in a tabbed work area.

You can harness the usage of Jupyter notebooks in data-driven applications by benefitting from the seamless integration of the JupyterLab environment and the pipeline modeler application.

### Data Cataloging

SAP Data Intelligence enables a unified data catalog to easily discover, organize, and curate your data.

SAP Data Intelligence Metadata Explorer enables to:
* Discover data (crawl, profile, organize, link, and enrich) and make data accessible (browse, search)
* Classify and organize data (ML-driven auto-tag) and understand it (location, attributes, quality, lineage, sensitivity)
* Enforce centralized authorization and security for data orchestration, and control data quality standards

## SAP Data Intelligence Metadata Explorer - Main Capabilities

SAP Data Intelligence three main capabilities are:
* Data Governance and Discovery
* Data Quality Monitoring
* Data Preparation and Enrichment

### Data Governance and Discovery

Easily connect and browse data repository by searching and filtering across auto-discovered data assets.
